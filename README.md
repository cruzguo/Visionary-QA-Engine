# Visionary-QA-Engine
A Machine learning model that answers simple inputted questions based on inputted images. 
This project was a group project designed by 3 other teammates over the 2024 Hackalytics. In this repository includes the file needed to run the code and the machine learning model itself. To see an explanation of the project with the code, click on "Open in Colab."
Please email me at cruzguo0628@gmail.com if you would like a copy of the machine learning model in order to run the model. The file size is too big to post on Github. :/
